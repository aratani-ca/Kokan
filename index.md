# Kokan

Do you want to keep your social network up to date without being bombarded by social media? Welcome to Kokan!

Through Kokan you can let your contacts be always up to date with your newest phone number, email address or profile picture.

That's all? Yup. This is not an app designed to steal your time, but to give it back.

Ah, the name: it reads Ko-o-kan with a long o, it comes from Japanese and means exchange. The expression meishi k≈çkan means the exchange of business cards!
;)

## Privacy Policy

This app is in development, so I do get to see everything uploaded to the database.

What it uploads:
  1. Your authenticated email and phone number.
  2. A list of the emails and phone numbers of all your contacts (without names). This is for the server to find your contacts and link you with them.
  3. Once you are linked with a contact, the app will upload your "card", which should contain your contact information. It is delivered to your contact and deleted. It is stored without encryption in the server (to be fixed in the future).

What it does NOT upload:
  1. Your photo (yet).
  2. Your GPS coordinates.
  3. Any unique identifier for online marketing, or things like that.

The deletion process is still manual, so you have to send me an email requesting to delete your data. You'll have to use the authenticated email address to prove your identity.
